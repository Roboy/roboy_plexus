Description: Tools for directing, throttling, selecting, and otherwise messing with
            ROS topics at a meta level. None of the programs in this package actually
            know about the topics whose streams they are altering; instead, these
            tools deal with messages as generic binary blobs. This means they can be
            applied to any ROS topic.
